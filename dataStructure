Nodes:
* Players
* Teams
* Seasons
* Managers
* League (For now we can focus on the EPL)
* Matches? or is an edge between Seasons and the team playing enough?
Might be best to have Matches as a Node for easy stat lookup


Hierarchical structure?
                Season
                /   \
               /     \
              /       \
           League    League
            /           \
           /             \
          /               \
        Teams            Teams
        /                   \
       /                     \
      /                       \
    Players                  Players

Unnecessary abstraction?


Other ideas?

Team -(current)-> player
Team -(former)-> player
Team -(plays_in)-> League
Team -(played_in)-> LeagueB
Team <-(match)- Season -(match)-> Team

OR

Team -(played_in)-> Match <-(played_in)- Team
                      |
                  (occurred_in)
                      |
                    Season

Is this even possible? #noob
